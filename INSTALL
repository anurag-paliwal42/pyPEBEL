#+TITLE: pyPEBEL Installation Documentation

* Overview

pyPEBEL has been designed as a python 3.x module and has been built
against the python 3.x version of Charm. The deployment for pyPEBEL
has been checked solely on Ubuntu 12.10, NO OTHER platforms will be
checked, unless there is a great demand.

A make file is also provided that abstracts over the installation of
the module itself, and documentation generation. The Makefile also has
targets used during development.

* Dependencies

The current dependencies for pyPEBEL are:

+ [ ] Python3
+ [ ] pyCrypto
+ [ ] Charm-Crypto
  - [ ] pyParsing
  - [ ] PBC
  - [ ] GMP

* Instructions

** Prerequisites

To install Charm on Ubuntu 12.10 the following tools also need to
be installed.

*** Building

Git, m4, libssl-dev, GMP, and checkinstall.

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install git m4 libssl-dev libgmp3c3 limpgmp3-dev checkinstall
#+end_src

[[http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/][Checkinstall]] is a nice Linux utility to install source build software
inside a deb/rpm managed distro.

*** Python Modules

Both pyCrypto and pyParsing are within the standard repositories for
python. Installation is simply:

#+begin_src sh
sudo pip install pycrypto
sudo pip install pyparsing
#+end_src

Alternatively on Ubuntu there are the python3 version of the modules in
repositories.

** PBC Library

PBC is a pairing based crypto library, available from:
http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/ Installation instructions are supplied
with the project. After compilation from source instead of doing
=make install= I recommend doing =checkinstall=.

*** Checkinstall doc-pak information
+ Description :: The PBC (Pairing-Based Cryptography) library is a
                 free C library (released under the GNU Lesser General
                 Public License) built on the GMP library that
                 performs the mathematical operations underlying
                 pairing-based cryptosystems.
+  Source location :: http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/files/pbc-0.5.13.tar.gz
+ provides :: pbc
+ requires :: libgmp3c2, libgmp3-dev


** Charm

Charm is a framework for the rapid prototyping of advanced
cryptography, it is available from: http://www.charm-crypto.com/
Installation instructions are supplied with the project. After
compilation from source instead of doing =make install= I recommend
doing =checkinstall=.

*** Checkinstall doc-pak information 
+ Description :: Charm is a framework for rapidly prototyping advanced
                 cryptosystems.  Based on the Python language, it was
                 designed from the ground up to minimize development
                 time and code complexity while promoting the reuse of
                 components.
+ Source Location :: https://github.com/JHUISI/charm
+ requires :: pbc, libgmp3c2, libgmp3-dev, python3, m4, python3-dev,
              python3-pyparsing, libssl-dev
+ provides :: charm



** pyPEBEL

To install pyPEBEL into your site-package simply invoke the following
commands:
#+begin_src sh
python3 distribute_setup.py check build install
#+end_src

IF successful the module and commandline scripts should be added to
your python3 site-packages, and PATH.

* Building Documentation

** API Documentation

Although pyDoc can be used to generate the API documentation pyDoctor is
the preferred documentation tool for this project.

#+begin_src sh
sudo pip install pyDoctor
pydoctor --project-name=pebel --make-html pebel
#+end_src

Documentation can then be found within the folder =apidocs=.
